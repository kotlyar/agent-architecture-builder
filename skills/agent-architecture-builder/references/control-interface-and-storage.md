# Control interface and storage decisions

Decide these after the work, authority, and persistent-state requirements are
known. Interface and database choices are independent: a browser panel may use
files, and a conversation-based system may use PostgreSQL.

## 1. Control interface

Evaluate the actual operators, frequency, visibility needs, approvals, and
operating environment.

### Conversation

Prefer conversation when:

- one or a few users assign work irregularly;
- natural-language clarification is valuable;
- status can be summarized rather than continuously displayed;
- artifacts can live in project files;
- risky actions can be approved in the same live conversation.

Do not use conversation history as the authoritative business database.

### Command line

Prefer the command line when:

- the primary operator is technical;
- tasks are scriptable and local;
- reproducibility and logs matter more than visual overview;
- no nontechnical multi-user workflow is required.

### Browser control panel

Prefer a web interface when at least one of these is confirmed:

- nontechnical users must operate the system without learning commands;
- multiple users need a shared queue and current state;
- users must compare many tasks, runs, costs, or results at once;
- approvals require structured forms and visible exact parameters;
- a durable audit history, filters, or role-based views are needed;
- the interface is itself part of the required product.

A browser panel is not justified solely by having multiple agents.

Minimum panel views, only when relevant:

1. work queue and status;
2. task details, inputs, evidence, and artifacts;
3. approval request with exact target, account, action, content, and budget;
4. execution and error history;
5. agent health and current responsibility;
6. settings that expose authority limits without revealing secrets.

### API and notifications

Prefer an API when another system is the main caller. Prefer notifications when
routine work can run elsewhere and the user only needs meaningful changes,
failures, completion, or approval requests.

### Combination

Use several interfaces only when each has a distinct job. Example: an API creates
tasks, a browser panel handles approvals, and notifications surface failures.
Name the authoritative source of status so the views cannot silently diverge.

## 2. Storage

First list each durable object: goals, tasks, decisions, evidence, artifacts,
approvals, external-action records, schedules, and agent-owned state. For
each object define owner, readers, writers, retention, sensitivity, and source of
truth.

### Files only

Prefer Markdown, JSON, or YAML files when:

- one process usually writes at a time;
- the dataset is small and human review matters;
- version control and portable artifacts are valuable;
- queries are simple;
- transaction guarantees are unnecessary.

Use explicit directories, schemas, stable identifiers, dates, and append-only
history where overwriting would destroy evidence.

### SQLite

Prefer SQLite when:

- the system runs on one host;
- structured queries, filters, or an event log are useful;
- write concurrency is limited;
- zero-service deployment matters;
- the database file can be backed up safely.

Do not put secrets into the database merely for convenience. Define migrations,
backup, and recovery before calling it production-ready.

### PostgreSQL

Prefer PostgreSQL when:

- multiple processes or users write concurrently;
- transactions and stronger consistency matter;
- the service runs across hosts or containers;
- row-level permissions, robust migrations, or operational monitoring are
  required;
- expected volume or query complexity exceeds a local embedded store.

The operational cost is justified only by confirmed requirements.

### Vector search

Do not add a vector database by default. Use ordinary files or database fields
when exact identifiers and structured filters solve retrieval. Add embeddings
only after a realistic retrieval test shows a semantic-search need. Record the
embedding model, source chunks, deletion behavior, and reproducibility limits.

### No separate database

Choose no new database when authoritative state already exists in external
systems and the agent only needs temporary working data. Store only pointers,
evidence snapshots, and decisions needed for auditability.

## 3. Authority and audit records

For each externally mutating operation store:

- request identifier and timestamp;
- initiating user or component;
- exact target and account;
- proposed action and parameters;
- approval identity, scope, and time;
- idempotency key where supported;
- observed result or `result_unknown`;
- verification attempt and recovery decision.

Never retry an action with an unknown result until state has been checked or the
user has explicitly decided how to proceed.

## 4. Required decision record

Document:

| Decision | Choice | Confirmed requirement | Rejected alternative | Cost or risk | Review trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Control interface |  |  |  |  |  |
| System-of-record storage |  |  |  |  |  |
| Artifact storage |  |  |  |  |  |
| Secrets storage |  |  |  |  |  |
| Audit history |  |  |  |  |  |

If the evidence is insufficient, select the simplest reversible option and label
it provisional.
